# Cowork Bootcamp — Session 3: Meeting Prep & Email

Your agent becomes your executive assistant. Research anyone before a call, pull your shared history, and walk in with a rapport builder ready — all in 2 minutes instead of 20.

## Skills

| Skill | Say This | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Meeting Prep** | "Prep me for my 2pm call" | A 3-layer research agent that builds a full meeting brief. **Layer 1: Person Intelligence** — web searches the person so you never get caught not knowing who someone is. **Layer 2: Relationship History** — pulls from Gmail threads, meeting transcripts, CRM, Slack, and shared docs to surface your shared history and open items. **Layer 3: Rapport Builder** — finds one genuine connection point (Dale Carnegie style) so you walk in warm. Saves contact profiles to your Book of Names so every future brief gets better. |

## Commands

| Command | Shortcut | What It Orchestrates |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Meeting Prep** | `/meeting-prep` | Runs the full 7-step pipeline: get meeting details → person intelligence → relationship history → rapport builder → compile brief → review → save + Rolodex update |

## Connectors

Connectors are optional. Meeting Prep works with just web search — but every connector you add makes the brief stronger.

| Connector | Say This | What It Adds |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Gmail** | "Connect Gmail" | Your agent reads your inbox, searches email history, and drafts replies in your voice. Meeting Prep pulls past email threads with that person automatically — plus meeting transcript emails from Fireflies, Fathom, Otter, and Zoom. Bonus: say "triage my inbox" to sort unread into Action/FYI/Can Wait/Trash. |
| **Fireflies** | "Connect Fireflies" | Your agent reads full meeting transcripts from Fireflies.ai. Meeting Prep gets deeper context — not just email summaries, but everything that was said. Say "recap my last call with [person]" for instant meeting summaries with action items. |
| **CRM** | "Set up my CRM" | Gives your agent a memory for people. If you already use a CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive), connect it. If not, set up a Notion **"Book of Names"** database in 5 minutes — a digital Rolodex that compounds with every meeting. In Session 6, you'll learn to build custom connectors for any CRM. |

## Session Order

Total time: ~25 minutes.

1. **Gmail Connector** — connect your email so your agent has inbox context *(5 minutes)*
2. **Fireflies Connector** *(optional)* — connect meeting transcripts for deeper history *(5 minutes)*
3. **CRM Connector** — set up your Book of Names in Notion or connect your existing CRM *(5 minutes)*
4. **Meeting Prep** — prep for your next call and watch it pull from everything *(10 minutes)*

The skill works with zero connectors — you can paste context manually or rely on web research alone. But with Gmail connected, your agent finds relevant emails. With Fireflies, it knows what was said. With CRM, it remembers rapport notes from past meetings. The more you connect, the better the brief gets over time.

After this session, you never walk into a meeting cold again. Session 4 adds project kits and presentations.
