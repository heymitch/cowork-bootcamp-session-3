## Skills

| Skill | Say This | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Meeting Prep** | "Prep me for my 2pm call" | Pulls context from every connected source — email threads, past transcripts, shared docs, Slack mentions — and builds a full brief: who you're meeting, last interaction, open items, suggested talking points. Shows you what it found and what sources it used. |

## Connectors

| Connector | Say This | What It Adds |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Gmail** | "Connect Gmail" | Your agent reads your inbox, searches email history, and drafts replies in your voice. Meeting Prep pulls past email threads with that person automatically. Bonus: includes email triage — say "triage my inbox" and it sorts unread into Action/FYI/Can Wait/Trash. |
| **Fireflies** | "Connect Fireflies" | Your agent reads full meeting transcripts from Fireflies.ai. Meeting Prep gets richer context — not just email summaries, but everything that was said. Say "recap my last call with [person]" for instant meeting summaries with action items. |

## Session Order

Total time: ~20 minutes.

1. **Gmail Connector** — connect your email so your agent has inbox context *(5 minutes)*
2. **Fireflies Connector** *(optional)* — connect meeting transcripts for deeper context *(5 minutes)*
3. **Meeting Prep** — prep for your next call and watch it pull from everything *(10 minutes)*

The skill works even without connectors — you can paste context manually. But with Gmail connected, your agent finds relevant emails on its own. With Fireflies, it knows what was said in past meetings. The more you connect, the better the brief.

After this session, you never walk into a meeting cold again. Session 4 adds project kits and presentations.
