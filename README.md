# Meeting Prep

Never walk into a meeting cold — gather context from Gmail, Slack, Docs, and Fireflies, build a comprehensive brief, track action items, and write follow-up emails.

## Install

Upload the ZIP via **Plugins > Upload Plugin** in Claude Cowork.

## What You Get

Install this plugin and 4 new capabilities appear in your `/` menu:

| Skill | Say This | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Context Gatherer** | "Gather context for my meeting with Sarah" | Pulls everything about a person from Gmail, Slack, Docs, Fireflies, and Calendar in parallel. Gives you a complete picture of your shared history in seconds. |
| **Brief Builder** | "Build a meeting brief for Sarah" | Takes raw context and assembles a structured brief — who they are, your history, open items, talking points, and what to watch for. Ready to skim in 60 seconds. |
| **Action Tracker** | "What's open from my meetings?" | Scans your meeting transcripts and emails for action items. Shows what you owe, what they owe, and what's overdue — with the source for every item. |
| **Follow-Up Writer** | "Write a follow-up for my meeting with Sarah" | Drafts a post-meeting recap email with discussion points, action items with owners, and next steps. Formal or casual tone based on the relationship. |

The **router** runs invisibly in the background — say "prep me for my meeting with Sarah" and it runs context-gatherer then brief-builder automatically without you needing to invoke each skill manually.

## Suggested Order (First Time)

1. **Context Gatherer** — pick someone you have a meeting with this week and say "gather context for my meeting with [name]" *(2 min)*
2. **Brief Builder** — say "build a brief" and watch it assemble everything into a scannable format *(1 min)*
3. **Action Tracker** — say "what's open from my meetings?" to see your outstanding commitments *(2 min)*
4. **Follow-Up Writer** — after your next meeting, say "write a follow-up" to draft the recap email *(1 min)*
