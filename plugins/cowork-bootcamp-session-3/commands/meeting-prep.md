Orchestrate the full meeting prep pipeline:

1. **Identify the meeting** — check calendar or ask who and when
2. **Person intelligence** — web search for their background, role, company, online presence (references/person-research.md)
3. **Relationship history** — pull from every connected source: CRM/Notion Book of Names, Gmail threads, Gmail transcript emails (Fireflies/Fathom/Otter/Zoom), Fireflies full transcripts, Slack mentions, Google Docs
4. **Rapport builder** — find one genuine connection point from CRM notes, their recent posts, or shared experiences (references/rapport-building.md)
5. **Compile brief** — who you're meeting, shared history, open items, recent context, rapport builder, talking points, sources used (references/brief-template.md)
6. **Review** — show the brief, wait for approval
7. **Save + Rolodex** — save brief to Notion/local, offer to update Book of Names with new contact info

Run the meeting-prep skill with all 3 intelligence layers: person research, relationship history, rapport building.
