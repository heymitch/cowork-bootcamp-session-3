# Gmail Connector

Connect your agent to Gmail so it can read emails, draft replies, and pull inbox context into other skills.

## Setup

1. Open Cowork Settings > Integrations > Google
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Grant read and write access to Gmail
4. Test: tell your agent "Show me my 5 most recent emails"

## Quick Win: Email Triage

Tell your agent: "Triage my inbox from today"

What it does:

- Scans unread emails
- Sorts them into 4 buckets: Action needed / FYI / Can wait / Trash
- Drafts quick replies for "Action needed" items in your voice
- Shows the plan before touching anything
- Never sends without your approval

## What Your Agent Can Do With Gmail

- Read and search emails
- Draft replies in your voice
- Pull email threads into Meeting Prep (see [Meeting Prep](../meeting-prep/SKILL.md))
- Flag important messages
- Summarize long email chains

## Troubleshooting

- Can't see emails? Check that you granted read permission in Step 3
- Drafts not in your voice? Run Voice Training first (see [Voice Training](../voice-training/SKILL.md))
