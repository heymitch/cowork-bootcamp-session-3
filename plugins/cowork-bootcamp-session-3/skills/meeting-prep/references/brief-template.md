# Meeting Brief Template

This is the output format. Every meeting prep produces this brief.

## The Brief

```markdown
# Meeting Brief: [Person Name] — [Company]
**Date:** [Meeting date/time]
**Meeting type:** [Call/Zoom/In-person/etc.]

---

## Who You're Meeting
[3-5 bullets from person research — title, company, notable background]
[If new contact: clearly state "First meeting — no prior history"]

## Your Shared History
[If CRM/Rolodex has an entry: pull it]
[Past emails: summarize the thread arc — when it started, what about, where it stands]
[Past meetings: key decisions, action items, tone of relationship]
[If no history: "No prior interactions found. This is a fresh conversation."]

## Open Items
[Unfinished action items from past interactions]
[Promises made by either side that haven't been completed]
[If none: "No open items."]

## Recent Context
[Email/Slack activity since last meeting]
[News about their company]
[Anything time-sensitive]

## Rapport Builder
[One personal detail, recent win, or shared interest to open with]
[Something they recently posted you can genuinely reference]
[Mutual connection or shared experience if any]

## Suggested Talking Points
1. [Based on open items + meeting purpose]
2. [Based on recent context]
3. [Based on their current priorities/challenges]

## Landmines
[Recent controversies or sensitive topics to avoid]
[Internal context that shouldn't be shared]
[If none: skip this section entirely]

## Sources Used
[List which connectors contributed: Gmail ✓, Fireflies ✓, CRM ✓, Web ✓, Slack ✗]
[If key sources were missing: "This brief would be stronger with [source] connected."]
```

## Adapting the Template

### For a first meeting (no history)
- Person Research section gets extra depth (more web search)
- Shared History says "First meeting"
- Rapport Builder is critical — find something to connect on
- Talking Points lean on their public work and meeting purpose

### For a recurring contact (rich history)
- Person Research is lighter (just check for recent news)
- Shared History is the star — pull from CRM, email, transcripts
- Open Items are critical — what's unfinished?
- Talking Points are specific to the relationship

### For group meetings (multiple attendees)
- Brief each person separately in condensed format (3 bullets each)
- Highlight the decision-maker and their priorities
- Note relationship dynamics between attendees if known

## Save After the Meeting

After the call, prompt: "Want me to update your Rolodex with notes from this meeting?"
- Add meeting date, key outcomes, new action items
- Update rapport notes with anything personal learned
- Save to CRM/Notion or local contact file
