# Person Research — Who Am I Talking To?

This is the "never walk in blind" layer. Before touching internal sources, research the person externally so you know who they are even if you've never met.

## What to Search

Run these searches in parallel using web search:

1. **"[Full Name] [Company]"** — Their professional identity
2. **"[Full Name] LinkedIn"** — Their LinkedIn profile (headline, role, experience)
3. **"[Full Name] Twitter" OR "[Full Name] X"** — Their social presence and recent takes
4. **"[Company Name] news"** — What's happening at their company right now

## What to Extract

### Professional Profile
- Full name, title, company
- What the company does (one sentence)
- How long they've been in role
- Career trajectory (where did they come from?)
- Notable accomplishments, publications, speaking appearances

### Online Presence
- LinkedIn headline and recent posts (what are they talking about publicly?)
- X/Twitter activity — their takes, what they engage with
- Podcast appearances, articles, interviews
- Conference talks or panels

### Company Context
- Company size, stage, recent funding
- Recent news (launches, hires, pivots)
- Industry and competitors

## What NOT to Do

- Don't stalk personal social media (Facebook, Instagram) unless it's clearly professional
- Don't include gossip or unverified claims
- Don't over-research — 2 minutes of web search, not 20. Get the signal, skip the noise.
- If the person has almost no online presence, say so. That's useful info too.

## How to Present

Synthesize into 3-5 bullet points under "Who You're Meeting" in the brief. Not a biography — the things that matter for THIS conversation.

Example:
```
**Who You're Meeting**
- Sarah Chen — VP of Engineering at Relay (Series B, AI-powered logistics)
- Previously: Staff engineer at Stripe for 6 years
- Active on LinkedIn — recent posts about engineering hiring challenges
- Relay just raised $40M last month, expanding the team
- Podcast guest on "Engineering Leadership" last quarter
```
