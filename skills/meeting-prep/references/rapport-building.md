# Rapport Building — The Dale Carnegie Layer

Dale Carnegie kept a Rolodex. Every person he met, he wrote down: their name, something personal about them, what they cared about. Next time he saw them, he'd reference it. People felt known.

This is the digital version. Your agent builds and maintains that Rolodex so you walk in warm every time.

## What Makes a Good Rapport Builder

A rapport builder is ONE thing you can reference in the first 2 minutes that makes the other person think "this person did their homework" or "we have something in common."

### Tier 1: Shared Experience (strongest)
- You both know the same person
- You attended the same event or conference
- You worked at the same company (different times)
- You're in the same community or group

### Tier 2: Genuine Interest in Their Work
- Reference a specific post they wrote (not "I saw your LinkedIn" — cite the actual take)
- Mention a podcast or talk they gave and what you took from it
- Note a recent accomplishment ("Congrats on the Series B — that's a big milestone")

### Tier 3: Personal Connection
- Shared hobby or interest discovered from social media
- Same city, school, or background
- Something timely (recent birthday, work anniversary on LinkedIn)

### What to Avoid
- Generic flattery ("I'm a big fan of your work")
- Referencing something too personal or creepy
- Name-dropping without a real connection
- Anything that feels rehearsed or forced

## The Rolodex Pattern

### Building It
Every meeting brief saves contact data. Over time, the agent accumulates:
- Professional details (title, company, role)
- Interaction history (when you met, what you discussed)
- Personal notes (interests, family mentions, pet peeves)
- Rapport notes (what topics lit them up, what fell flat)
- CTA status (what are they buying/selling/building?)

### Using It
Before any meeting, the agent checks the Rolodex FIRST:
1. **CRM/Notion check** — Do we have a record for this person?
2. **If yes:** Load it. Use stored rapport notes + check for updates since last interaction.
3. **If no:** Build a fresh profile from web research. After the meeting, save it.

### Maintaining It
After meetings, prompt: "Anything I should remember about [person] for next time?"
- Store it in the CRM/Notion contact entry
- Include: personal details shared, topics they care about, communication style preferences
- This compounds over time — the 5th meeting brief is dramatically better than the 1st

## Where to Store the Rolodex

In priority order:
1. **Notion database** (via CRM connector) — structured, searchable, shareable
2. **Other CRM** (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive) — if they already use one
3. **Local contacts/ directory** — markdown file per person as fallback

See the CRM connector for Notion template setup.
