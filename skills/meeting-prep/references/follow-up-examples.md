Hi Sarah,

Thank you for making time today. Here's a summary of what we covered:

- Reviewed the Q1 content pipeline results — 40% time savings confirmed
- Discussed adding newsletter automation to the skill pack
- Agreed on a demo for your CEO in early March

Action items:
- Mitch: Send newsletter skill proposal by Feb 24
- Sarah: Share CEO's availability for demo week of March 2
- Mitch: Schedule new hire training by Feb 28

Next steps: I'll have the proposal in your inbox by Monday. Let me know when your CEO is free and I'll set up the demo.

Best,

**When to use:** First meeting, new client, executive audience, anyone you don't have an established rapport with. Full sentences, professional closings, "Thank you for..." openings.

## Choosing the Right Tone

| Signal | → Tone |
|--------|--------|
| First meeting | Formal |
| Client you've worked with 3+ times | Casual |
| Executive / C-suite | Formal (unless they write casually to you) |
| Internal teammate | Casual |
| Partner / peer | Casual |
| Not sure | Default casual — it's warmer and feels more human |
