## Talking Points

1. **Newsletter skill proposal** — She asked for this two weeks ago. Bring the pricing and walk through it. This is overdue.
2. **CEO demo** — She mentioned her CEO wants to see the tools. Offer to do a 15-min recorded demo they can share internally. This could expand the account.
3. **New hire training** — Overdue from January. Apologize briefly, propose a date this week. Don't let it slip again.
4. **Podcast mention** — Congrats on the new show. Light touch — don't force it.

## Watch For

- The training session delay might be a sore point. Acknowledge it first, don't wait for her to bring it up.
- CEO demo interest could mean budget expansion — or it could mean they're evaluating alternatives. Ask how the conversation came up.
- She's been very positive publicly (LinkedIn tag). Good sign. Don't take it for granted.
