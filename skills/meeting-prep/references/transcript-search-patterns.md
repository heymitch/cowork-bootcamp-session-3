[company name] (transcript OR recording OR "meeting notes" OR "meeting summary")
```

```

```

## How to Extract Key Info from Transcript Emails

Most transcript emails follow the same structure. Here's what to pull:

1. **Attendees** — Listed at the top. Map names to roles if possible.
2. **Duration** — How long the meeting lasted. Short meetings (15 min) were probably quick check-ins. Long meetings (60+ min) had substance.
3. **Summary** — The AI-generated summary is the highest-value section. Read it first.
4. **Action items** — Most services detect and list these. Check who owns each item.
5. **Key topics** — Services tag main discussion themes. Use these for talking points.
6. **Date** — When the meeting happened. Critical for the "Last Interaction" section of the brief.

## Tips

- **Check your spam/promotions folder.** Transcript emails sometimes get filtered. If you find one there, mark it as "Not spam" so future ones land in your inbox.
- **Search by date range.** Add `after:2025/11/01 before:2026/02/20` to limit results to a specific period.
- **Multiple recording services.** Some people use different services for different meeting types (Zoom recordings for sales calls, Fireflies for internal). Search for all of them.
- **Person's name might not appear.** If the meeting title doesn't include their name, search by company name or meeting date instead.
- **Forwarded transcripts.** Sometimes colleagues forward meeting summaries. Search for `[person name] transcript` without the sender filter to catch these.
- **Calendar cross-reference.** If you can see the meeting on your calendar, use the exact meeting title in your Gmail search. That's often the most reliable match.
